K3 surfaces with a unique elliptic fibration

Guide to files:
- Code_Paper_NonThin.magma: computes the finite list of Picard lattices of K3 surfaces with an infinite automorphism group and a unique genus 1 fibration.
- Finite.txt: Picard lattices of K3 surfaces with finite automorphism group (required as input).
- Borcherds.txt: Picard lattices of K3 surfaces with zero entropy infinite automorphism group (required as input).
- Unique_Elliptic_Fibration.txt: the resulting finite list of Picard lattices of K3 surfaces with a unique genus 1 fibration using the above MAGMA code, including also those cases with finite automorphism group, which can be computed by hand.
